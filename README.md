This program allows the user to play a game of rock paper scissors against the computer.

Program will ask user to input a number between 1-3 to choose between rock, paper, and scissors.
Based on the user input and the random number the computer chooses, the program will output the outcome of the game (draw, win, lose). Not much else I can say!
